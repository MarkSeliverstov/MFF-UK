# MFF Individual Software Project 2023

[Info](https://ksvi.mff.cuni.cz/~dingle/isp.html)

### Plan

- [ ] Choice Theme (x.3 - deadline)
- [ ] Choice Tutor (28.3 - deadline)
- [ ] Write Specifikation (x.4 - deadline)
- [ ] Write Project
- [ ] Write Documentation

### Project components in detail

- Problem statement - a short description of the program agreed to:
    - Name, cca 5-15 line description of the topic, OS, language, libraries or other external components, development environment, ...

- Detailed specification - a detailed description of the proposed implementation which would allow another programmer to write "the same" program:
    - A short analysis of existing programs, a description of all significant intended functionality and attributes of the program, emphasizing how it will differ from existing programs (how it will be better, which additional features it will have, and so on)
    - A description of the main functions
    - A design for the structure of the program (modules, libraries, possibly a framework, mutual dependencies)
    - OS, language, development environment, other source code to be used (libraries, modules, and so on)

- Implementation
    - a sufficiently large self-contained part of the application that reliably works in the scope of the specfied/agreed functionality.
    - scope and functionality to be agreed on in advance, but certainly not only a shallow GUI

- Final version
    - A functional, stable software product with a usable user interface and/or programming interface.
    - An 'installation package' containing everything necessary for installing and launching (libraries, configuration, data, ...)
    - Test data - if the program requires certain data to demonstrate its functionality, the data must be included in such a way that the full functionality can be demonstrated.
    - Documentation

### Standard documentation requirements

- Installation manual - describes how to install, configure and launch the program
- User's guide - describes how to use the program (what it is possible to do with the program, and how), as well as the user interface
- Developer documentation - how to compile the program, a description of the implementation (what, in what language, how), a description of non-trivial algorithms and data structures
    - Text automatically generated from source code (Doxygen, Javadoc, ...) is not considered to be developer documentation
    - The documentation should consist of what is not in the source code.

### Themes:

1. Git vizualizator
2. Kompilator
3. Extention
4. App for mobile (Xamarin)
5.
